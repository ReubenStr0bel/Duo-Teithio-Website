Add link to project once deployed

Duo Teithio is a classical ensemble of two members who need a website to communicate information with audience members and provide a method to enquire about bookings. Potential clients will be able to view biographical information, a gallery of performance recordings, and sign up to a newsletter. For organisations such as concert venues or booking agents, the website should showcase the duo's performance style, professionalism, and performance experience.

### Design
#### Colour Scheme
  ![Colour scheme](./readme_assets/images/colour_scheme.png)
  This colour scheme was chosen to compliment the main hero image and work with a metallic gold colour to be used as a highlight.
#### Typography
  The Montserrat font is used throughout the website. It is modern and stylish while still being easy to read at smaller sizes. Sans Serif is used as a fall back in case of issues with importing the font into the site.
#### Imagery
  The main hero image is of Duo Teithio with a gold background and images throughout convey a sense of sophistication as well as showcasing the various instruments played by the duo.
