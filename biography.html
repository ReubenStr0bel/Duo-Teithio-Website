                    In 2019, he became one of the few musicians in the college's history to transfer from the strings department to woodwind mid-course. He now plays over 50 instruments spanning flutes, clarinets, saxophones, double reeds, strings, and ethnic/world instruments.

                    Reuben studied piano at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama from 2019-2023 with the generous support of a scholarship from the Leverhulme Trust, and graduated with first-class honours. While studying at the college Reuben developed a passion for chamber music, which he performed in various forms including vocal and instrumental duos and in piano trios and quartets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to his chamber music work and solo recitals - including a performance of Saint-Saëns Piano Concerto no.5 in his final year - Reuben undertook research into the role of neuroplasticity in learning and practising the piano. He now uses this research to further his own development as a musician and in his private teaching.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reuben has performed in various venues in the UK and internationally, including the Dora Stoutzker Hall and St. David’s Hall in Cardiff, the Qatar National Convention Centre, and the Dubai Opera House and Madinat Theatre in the UAE. He also now performs accross the globe in classical recitals with Cunard, P&O and Fred Olsen cruise lines.
